    caption: Installing AWS Code Habits

title: AWS Code Habits

description: A library with Make targets, Ansible playbooks, Jinja templates (and more) designed to boost common software development tasks and enhance governance.

getting_started: |-
  You can adopt AWS Code Habits in two ways:

  ### 1. Remote (using Git Submodules)
  On a terminal, on your project root directory, execute the following on Ubuntu:

  ```bash
  curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awslabs/aws-code-habits/main/scripts/remote/init.sh | bash
  ```

  ### 2. Standalone (without Git Submodules)
   On a terminal, on your project root directory, execute the following on Ubuntu:

  ```bash
  curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awslabs/aws-code-habits/main/scripts/standalone/init.sh | bash
  ```

  ### How to import environment variables
  Create a `.env` file, example:

  ```bash
  echo 'ENVIRONMENT=dev' > dev.env
  ```

  Now include `dev.env` into your Makefile, for example:
  ```bash
  export WORKSPACE=$(shell pwd)
  export HABITS = $(WORKSPACE)

  include $(WORKSPACE)/dev.env
  include $(WORKSPACE)/dev.secrets.env # remember to add *.secrets.env to .gitignore

  include $(HABITS)/lib/make/Makefile
  include $(HABITS)/lib/make/*/Makefile
  ```

  ### How to build documentation (powered by Ansible and Jinja)
  Make your changes on [habits.yaml](doc/habits.yaml) and then execute:
  ```bash
  make doc/build
  ```

  All changes made on [README.md](README.md) directly will be overwritten.

  ### How to incorporate Habits

  You can use [Habits][habits] to meet your needs, example:
  ```bash
  .PHONY: hygiene
  hygiene: doc/build pre-commit/run
  ```

  For example, you want to perform several tasks with AWS CloudFormation:
  ```bash
  .PHONY: hygiene
  hygiene: aws/cloudformation/hygiene

  .PHONY: plan
  plan: aws/cloudformation/create-change-set

  .PHONY: discard
  discard: aws/cloudformation/delete-change-set

  .PHONY: apply
  apply: aws/cloudformation/execute-change-set
  ```

usage: |-

  ```bash
  make [tab][tab]
  ```

  ```bash
  make help
  ```
  For more information about each [Make targets available](Makefile.md).

  ### How to intialize all documentation files

  ```bash
  make doc/init
  ```

  This will create a folder named `doc/` in the root directory of your project and create a file named `habits.yaml` inside of it.
  Then after modifying the contents of `doc/habits.yaml`, execute:

  ```
  make doc/build
  ```

  ### How to initialize `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

  ```bash
  make pre-commit/init
  ```

  To run all `pre-commit` rules in all files, simply run:

  ```bash
  make pre-commit/run
  ```

  To perform habits checks:
  ```bash
  make habits/check
