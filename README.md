# AWS Code Habits

A library with Make targets, Ansible playbooks, Jinja templates (and more) designed to boost common software development tasks and enhance governance.

| *Installing AWS Code Habits* |

- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)


- [Usage](#usage)

- [Testing](#testing)


## Getting Started

You can adopt AWS Code Habits in two ways:

  ### 1. Remote (using Git Submodules)
  On a terminal, on your project root directory, execute the following on Ubuntu:

  ```bash
  curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awslabs/aws-code-habits/main/scripts/remote/init.sh | bash
  ```

  ### 2. Standalone (without Git Submodules)
   On a terminal, on your project root directory, execute the following on Ubuntu:

  ```bash
  curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awslabs/aws-code-habits/main/scripts/standalone/init.sh | bash
  ```

  ### How to import environment variables
  Create a `.env` file, example:

  ```bash
  echo 'ENVIRONMENT=dev' > dev.env
  ```

  Now include `dev.env` into your Makefile, for example:
  ```bash
  export WORKSPACE=$(shell pwd)
  export HABITS = $(WORKSPACE)

  include $(WORKSPACE)/dev.env
  include $(WORKSPACE)/dev.secrets.env # remember to add *.secrets.env to .gitignore

  include $(HABITS)/lib/make/Makefile
  include $(HABITS)/lib/make/*/Makefile
  ```

  ### How to build documentation (powered by Ansible and Jinja)
  Make your changes on [habits.yaml](doc/habits.yaml) and then execute:
  ```bash
  make doc/build
  ```

  All changes made on [README.md](README.md) directly will be overwritten.

  ### How to incorporate Habits

  You can use [Habits][habits] to meet your needs, example:
  ```bash
  .PHONY: hygiene
  hygiene: doc/build pre-commit/run
  ```

  For example, you want to perform several tasks with AWS CloudFormation:
  ```bash
  .PHONY: hygiene
  hygiene: aws/cloudformation/hygiene

  .PHONY: plan
  plan: aws/cloudformation/create-change-set

  .PHONY: discard
  discard: aws/cloudformation/delete-change-set

  .PHONY: apply
  apply: aws/cloudformation/execute-change-set
  ```


## Prerequisites
  A list of things you need, or how to install them.
  > At this stage, we are only supporting Linux (Ubuntu) environments (which can be obtained via WSL (Windows) or DevContainers (Mac/Linux/Windows))

- [Ubuntu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu) - Ubuntu is a Linux distribution based on Debian and composed mostly of free and open-source software.
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org) - Whether you're new to programming or an experienced developer, it's easy to learn and use Python.
- [Python Virtual Environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) - A virtual environment is created on top of an existing Python installation, known as the virtual environment’s “base” Python, and may optionally be isolated from the packages in the base environment, so only those explicitly installed in the virtual environment are available.
- [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) - Ansible is an open source community project sponsored by Red Hat, it's the simplest way to automate IT.
- [Jinja2](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_templating.html) - Ansible uses Jinja2 templating to enable dynamic expressions and access to variables and facts.



## Usage

  ```bash
  make [tab][tab]
  ```

  ```bash
  make help
  ```
  For more information about each [Make targets available](Makefile.md).

  ### How to intialize all documentation files

  ```bash
  make doc/init
  ```

  This will create a folder named `doc/` in the root directory of your project and create a file named `habits.yaml` inside of it.
  Then after modifying the contents of `doc/habits.yaml`, execute:

  ```
  make doc/build
  ```

  ### How to initialize `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

  ```bash
  make pre-commit/init
  ```

  To run all `pre-commit` rules in all files, simply run:

  ```bash
  make pre-commit/run
  ```


## Testing
To perform habits checks:
  ```bash
  make habits/check
  ```
